     * Performs five checks:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>Checks that all samples in the sample set have the same VCID. If not, the
     * sample set is rejected.</li>
     *
     * <li>Checks that all samples in the sample set have consecutive VCFCs. If not,
     * a warning is logged, but the sample set is not rejected. The exception to
     * this is when the mission-defined maximum VCFC value is reached and the
     * counter rolls over back to zero, in which case the rollover is merely logged
     * as info.</li>
     * 
     * <li>Checks that each sample's VCID is the same as its supplemental sample's
     * VCID iff the supplemental sample's VCID is available. If not, the sample set
     * is rejected. Some missions and/or telemetry sources don't use/provide the
     * VCID of the supplemental sample, so if it isn't available, this check is not
     * performed but a warning is logged.</li>
     *
     * <li>Checks that each sample's VCFC value is supplementalSampleOffset less
     * than its supplemental sample's VCFC iff the supplemental sample's VCFC is
     * available. In other words, verifies that timekeeping packets and their target
     * samples are separated by the number of samples configured for the mission. If
     * not, the sample set is rejected. Some missions and/or telemetry sources don't
     * use/provide the VCFC of the sample and/or the VCFC of the supplemental
     * sample, so if either isn't available, this check is not performed but a
     * warning is logged.</li>
     *
     * <li>Checks that each sample's VCID and VCFC matches its supplemental sample's
     * TK VCID and TK VCFC. In other words, verifies that the target sample VCID and
     * VCFC values reported by a timekeeping packet match the target sample's actual
     * VCID and VCFC. Some telemetry sources don't provide the VCFC of the sample,
     * so if it isn't available, then that portion of the check is not performed but
     * a warning is logged.</li>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param samples the sample set
     * @param config  the app configuration
     * @return true if the VCID is consistent among all samples, false otherwise
